# Linux ANT HAL library #

This repository contains the source to build the ANT HAL library (antradio_library.so) for use on Linux based platforms, including Android. Android makefiles are included to configure the build for a specific ANT part which is set in the board config.

## Branches ##
*Note: Development versions 1.6.1 and 1.6.2 were previously available on the _master_ branch. Any working branches created since version 1.6.0 (18 July 2013) must be rebased to the _development_ branch. While this may be irritating, it forces everyone on these branches to realise they are not using code which is "safe for release".*

### master ###
Versions that have been tested and are suitable for consumer devices.

### development ###
The latest, untested, development versions. These are made available for silicon vendors to verify code changes on parts/boards not available to ANT Wireless engineers.

### <X>_debug ###
Unmaintained, unsupported and untested code. These branches are purely used as a means of distributing in-progress work between engineers at different sites. They generally contain features and fixes developed by third parties.
